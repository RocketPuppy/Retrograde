Stellar Gate,,Y,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,"6,3,1","12,12,12,12",6,"Stellar Gate begins play on the field, uncontrolled by either player. At the beginning of your turn, if Stellar Gate has been under your control for four consecutive turns, then you win the game. Friendly spacecraft in orbit around Stellar Gate may transfer to any other asset without paying the delta-vee cost. Upgrades cannot be constructed on Stellar Gate."
