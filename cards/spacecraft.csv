Cloudraker,Y,4,10,6,2,2,4,T,"Can choose to end a transition burn in low orbit of an asset, but takes damage equal to the mass factor of the orbital."
Hyena FAV,Y,2,1,10,1,1,0,T,
Coyote FAV,Y,2,1,10,1,1,0,T,
Jackal FAV,Y,2,1,10,1,1,0,T,
Soilrazer,Y,4,10,6,3,2,3,T,"When bombarding an asset, you may choose a megastructure on the asset to receive one damage. This damage cannot be reduced in any way."
Olyphant Support Ship,Y,0,5,6,1,2,0,T,Spacecraft in the same orbital as this card may take one less damage when receiving damage from any source.
Itano's Cloud,Y,4,6,4,3,3,5,T,"When this spacecraft makes an attack, choose a spacecraft in orbit around the asset. That spacecraft must spend 2 delta-vee or receive 1 damage."
Cheetah Fleet Carrier,Y,1,2,20,1,2,0,T,"When this spacecraft moves, one other spacecraft in the same orbit may move with it."
Javelin Short-Range Defender,Y,4,1,10,0,1,0,T,When you construct this spacecraft it may immediately make an attack against a spacecraft in any orbital on the asset. Then it returns to construction with zero construction counters on it.
Mobile Construction Yard,Y,0,1,5,1,2,0,T,You may activate this spacecraft to add 1 construction to an asset or spacecraft under construction. You may do this only once per turn.
Pathmaker,Y,2,4,8,1,2,1,T,"When this spacecraft destroys another spacecraft, it may regain 1 delta-vee."
Herald of Destruction,Y,5,10,8,3,4,3,T,When this spacecraft orbits an asset for the first time all enemy spacecraft must spend one delta-vee or take one damage.
Steel Bathtub,Y,2,4,12,1,5,1,T,This spacecraft does not take damage from debris.
Scout Vessel,Y,1,1,8,1,1,0,E,Activate: Look at one hidden card attached to the orbitted asset.
Nanoswarm Reaper,Y,3,4,6,3,4,3,E,"When Nanoswarm Reaper damages an asset, that asset cannot be activated for the rest of the round."
Nanoswarm Regenerator,Y,1,5,10,2,2,1,E,"Activate: Nanoswarm Keeper takes one damage, a spacecraft in the same orbital gains one armor. This armor disappears at the end of the round."
Nanoswarm Sower,Y,2,3,8,2,2,1,E,Spacecraft damaged by Nanoswarm Sower cannot use the repair action for the rest of this round.
