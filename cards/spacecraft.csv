Cloudraker,Y,4,10,6,4,6,4,,"Can choose to end a transition burn in an inner orbital of an asset, but takes damage equal to half of the delta-vee value of the orbital."
Hyena FAV,Y,2,1,10,1,2,0,,
Coyote FAV,Y,2,1,10,1,2,0,,
Jackal FAV,Y,2,1,10,1,2,0,,
Soilrazer,Y,4,10,6,4,6,3,,"When bombarding an asset, you may choose a megastructure on the asset to receive one damage. This damage cannot be reduced in any way."
Olyphant Support Ship,Y,0,5,6,4,6,0,,Spacecraft in the same orbital as this card may take one less damage when receiving damage from any source.
Itano's Cloud,Y,4,6,4,6,8,5,,"When this spacecraft makes an attack, choose a spacecraft in orbit around the asset. That spacecraft must spend 2 delta-vee or receive 1 damage."

Javelin Short-Range Defender,Y,4,1,10,1,2,0,,When you construct this spacecraft it may immediately make an attack against a spacecraft in the same orbital. Then it returns to construction with zero construction counters on it.
Colonial Expediter,Y,0,1,4,6,8,0,,"You may command this spacecraft to move to an unsettled asset. If you do, remove this spacecraft from play and add 5 settlement counters to the asset."
Pathmaker,Y,2,4,8,3,4,1,,"When this spacecraft destroys another spacecraft, it may regain 1 delta-vee."
Herald of Destruction,Y,5,10,8,8,12,3,,When this spacecraft orbits an asset for the first time all enemy spacecraft must spend one delta-vee or take one damage.
